# 🎵 Music Track Management App

A single-page application built with React and Vite for managing a personal music track library. It interacts with a provided Node.js backend API to perform CRUD operations, upload audio files, and manage track metadata.

## ✨ Features

*   **Track Listing:** View all tracks in a paginated list on the main page (`/tracks`).
*   **Create Track:** Add new tracks with metadata (title, artist, album, cover image URL, genres) via a modal form.
    *   **Genre Management:** Fetch available genres from the API, display selected genres as tags with removal functionality, and add new genres from the available list.
    *   Client-side validation for required fields and cover image URL format.
*   **Edit Track:** Modify existing track metadata in a pre-filled modal form. Changes are saved to the API.
*   **Delete Track:** Remove tracks individually with a confirmation dialog.
*   **Audio File Upload:** Upload audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG) for existing tracks in a separate modal. Includes validation for file type and size, and an audio preview.
*   **Audio File Deletion:** Remove the associated audio file from a track (metadata remains) with a confirmation dialog.
*   **Audio Playback:**
    *   Play uploaded audio files directly within the track list using WaveSurfer.js.
    *   Only one track plays at a time.
    *   Visual waveform display for playing/loaded tracks.
*   **List Interaction:**
    *   **Pagination:** Navigate through large track lists.
    *   **Sorting:** Sort tracks by creation date, title, artist, or album (ascending/descending).
    *   **Filtering:** Filter tracks by genre or artist using dropdowns.
    *   **Search:** Search tracks by title, artist, or album with debouncing for performance.
*   **Bulk Actions:**
    *   Select multiple tracks using checkboxes.
    *   Delete selected tracks in a single operation with confirmation.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   All create/edit/upload/delete operations happen in **modals** without leaving the main track list view.
    *   **Loading Indicators:** Visual feedback during API requests and data loading.
    *   **Toast Notifications:** Clear feedback for successful operations and errors using `react-hot-toast`.
    *   **Optimistic UI Updates:** Edit, Delete, Delete File, and Bulk Delete operations update the UI instantly for a smoother experience, with rollback on API error.
*   **Styling:** Clean, dark-themed UI with styles organized in a dedicated `src/css` folder.
