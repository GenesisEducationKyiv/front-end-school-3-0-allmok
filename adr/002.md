# ADR-002: Implementing Optimistic Updates Directly in a Page Component

## Context

To improve user experience, operations such as editing or deleting tracks should reflect their effects immediately in the UI — without waiting for a server response. This behavior is known as optimistic updates and helps users feel the system is responsive and fast.

Initially, I used a custom hook `useTrackMutations` to encapsulate logic for modifying tracks. However, it became challenging to perform optimistic updates inside the hook due to its limited access to local UI state. Specifically, managing and updating the track list (stored in component-level state) from within the hook would require complex patterns such as callbacks or state lifting.

Given this, I explored other approaches to implement optimistic updates effectively.

## Decision

Implement optimistic update logic for the following operations directly within the `TracksPage.tsx` component:

- Update track data  
- Delete a single track  
- Bulk delete multiple tracks  
- Delete associated files from a track  
- Remove genres from a track  

The implementation includes:

- Saving the current state of the track list before the mutation.
- Instantly updating the local state of the track list (obtained from `useTracks` via `setTracks`) to reflect the expected change.
- Calling the appropriate API function to apply the change on the server.
- Handling success: optionally confirm the operation using the response or reload the updated list.
- Handling failure: if the API call fails, rollback the local state to the previously saved version and notify the user accordingly.
- Managing loading states for each mutation locally inside `TracksPage.tsx`.

This approach ensures faster visual feedback while maintaining the ability to recover gracefully in case of request failure.

## Rationale

**Alternative approaches considered:**

- **Implement all optimistic updates in the `useTrackMutations` hook:**  
  This would reduce the complexity of `TracksPage.tsx`, but would require the hook to receive and modify external state via callbacks, making it harder to maintain.

- **Use a server-state library (e.g., React Query, SWR):**  
  These libraries provide built-in support for optimistic updates and cache management. However, adding such a dependency would increase the learning curve and complexity of the project.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved UX: Users receive immediate feedback on their actions.
- Full control: Developers retain low-level control over how the UI updates and rolls back.
- Transparent handling: Errors are handled gracefully with rollback.

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity of `TracksPage.tsx`: More responsibilities placed on a single component, reducing clarity.
-  Duplication of logic: The pattern of “save state -> optimistically update -> call API -> handle success/failure -> rollback on error” can be repeated for several operations.
