# ADR-001: Choosing React and Vite for Development

## Context

I needed to choose the core frontend technologies for building the project's user interface and customizing the development environment.

## Decision

Use **React** as the UI library due to its flexibility, wide adoption, and component-based model.  
Use **Vite** as the build tool for faster startup, modern development experience, and improved performance over CRA and other bundlers.

## Rationale

I considered various options for both the UI library and build tool. React offers a robust ecosystem, component reusability, and a large community, making it a strong choice. As for the bundler, while tools like Webpack and Parcel are powerful and flexible, Vite stands out for its:

- Lightning-fast cold starts using native ES modules in development.
- Modern architecture and out-of-the-box support for TypeScript.
- Superior Hot Module Replacement (HMR) compared to Create React App (CRA).
- Simpler configuration and plugin ecosystem.

This combination aligns well with my goals for developer efficiency and modern best practices.

## Alternatives

- **Angular**: A more comprehensive framework that may be overkill for the scope of this project and has a steeper learning curve.
- **Vue.js**: A strong alternative, but React is more widely used and has a larger pool of available developers.
- **Create React App (CRA)**: Slower development startup and less efficient HMR compared to Vite.
- **Webpack**: Very flexible and configurable but has a steeper learning curve and slower build performance.
- **Parcel**: Offers zero-config experience, but Vite provides better performance and more flexibility for advanced setups.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development cycle with Vite.
- Ability to build complex and interactive UI with React.
- Type-safe and improved code quality with TypeScript.
- Easy to find solutions and libraries thanks to a large community.

**Negative:**
- Without proper state management structure and practices, large React applications can become difficult to maintain.
