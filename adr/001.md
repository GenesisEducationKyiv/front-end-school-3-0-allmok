#ADR-001: Choosing React and Vite for Development

Context.

    Choose the React library to build the user interface and the Vite build tool to customize the development environment and compile the project.

Alternatives

    Angular: A more comprehensive framework that may be overkill for a given project and has a steeper learning curve.

    Vue.js: A good alternative, but React is more widely used and potentially has a wider selection of specialists.

    Create React App (CRA): Slower start and HMR compared to Vite. Vite offers a more modern and faster development experience.

Consequences.

    Positive:

        Faster development cycle with Vite.

        Ability to build complex and interactive UI with React.

        Type-safe and improved code quality with TypeScript.

        Easy to find solutions and libraries thanks to a large community.

    Neutral:

        The need to customize tools for linting (ESLint) and code formatting (Prettier) to ensure consistency.

        React itself is a UI library, so decisions about state management, routing (if needed), and other aspects need to be made separately.

    Potentially negative:

        Without proper state management structure and approaches, large React applications can become difficult to maintain (partially addressed in the following ADRs).
